# Automations
Fun mini automation scripts I developed in my spare time.

### Movie Tickets
Scrapped event cinemas for 2 Unhinged tickets at 7.30pm. Movie selection and time session can easily be tweaked using Selenium. This program is only useful for high demand movies where, tickets are hard to come by.
